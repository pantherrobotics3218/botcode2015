# botcode2015

This repo contains the robot code for our 2015 robot year. This repository contains the files I was given by the bot programmers. I'm really not sure what's in it.

This code was written using National System's LabView for FRC platform.

I'm still getting this repository set up, so consider it a work in progress. The code itself is no longer under development.
