# botcode2015

This repo contains the robot code for our 2015 robot year. This repository contains the files I was given by the bot programmers. I'm really not sure what's in it.

This code was written using National System's LabView for FRC platform.

This repo is a work in progress, and is likely to remain that way throughout the summer.
